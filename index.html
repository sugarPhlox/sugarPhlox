          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Born in Massachusetts, I grew up surrounded with love and support by my family to
            pursue anything I enjoyed in the world, and took full advantage of that. In high school
            I enjoyed finer arts and photography, and took that with me to Salem State University
            (based in Salem, MA), where I received my degree in Graphic Design (after starting as
            a Biology major... really).
          </p>
          <p>
            In summer 2013, I looked at my cat Buddy and said 'We're moving to Burlington, VT', and
            a month later I moved, and soon after started learning front end development, which 
            has brought me here today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than my love for various forms of art, I do enjoy a good life in VT. My passions
            include my vehicles (a 2009 Subaru WRX and a motorcycle), good cooking, my fantastic cat,
            and learning something new every day.
